## Improving the list of experts

### Add new experts

If you want to suggest a new expert you can directly do a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or if you feel lazy, or do not know how to do that, [open a issue and fill this template](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/issues/new):

```

    "name": null,
    "picture": null,
    "linkedin": null,
    "twitter": null,
    "github": null,
    "geonet": null,

}
```

### Update existing profiles

**For developers**:

The existing profiles are located in the [experts.json](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/experts.json) file, so if you want, you can also update any existing profile doing a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or using the [online editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

**For non-developers**:

If you don't know how to do that [open page](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/), find the profile (Ctrl+F), click the question mark icon and click the "**please tell us**" link just above the "**Done**" button.
