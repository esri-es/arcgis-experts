### Add new experts

If you want to suggest a new expert you can directly do a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or if you feel lazy, or do not know how to do that, [open a issue](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/issues/new) and fill [this template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

> **Note:** having the support of other experts included in this list will help us on the evaluation process, so please let us know if any other expert is supporting this candidate.

### Update existing profiles

**For developers**:

The existing profiles are located in the [experts.json](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/experts.json) file, so if you want, you can also update any existing profile doing a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or using the [online editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

**For non-developers**:

In case you don't know how to do a pull request, [open the app](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/), find the profile (*use Ctrl+F*), click the question mark icon and then click the "**please tell us**" link just above the "**Done**" button.
