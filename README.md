# ArcGIS Experts

## What is this about
This is a curated list of experts in ArcGIS Technology we have found them at:

* [Esri's Github Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Esri/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=Nelson) (contributors)
* [Esri's Youtube Channels](https://esri-es.github.io/awesome-arcgis/esri/#youtube-channels) (speakers)
* [GeoNet](http://community.esri.com/), [StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=arcgis+esri) top contributors

We think this could be useful to find influencers you might want to follow in social networks.
