We have included people (working at Esri or not) we have found on:

* Known experts willing to help you [solving your questions on GeoNet](#solving-your-questions-on-geoNet)

Some of them are listed by other expert recommendations.

> **Important**: We will immediately remove all data from anyone who is listed in this project and who does not want to be. In this case please [open an issue](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/issues/new) an let us know.

## Why this project?

The initial idea was to help anyone interested on ArcGIS technologies to find and follow experts on any topic. We think it is very useful because:

* They create/publish personal articles, projects, etc are worth to know
* They share curated information
* Some of them are very active helping on GeoNet, Github issues, ... and been able to know them when dealing with an issue could be very useful
* Some times it is not easy to find an expert in one topic near you

So our main goal is to help anyone to find and follow the public activity of an expert but also to recognize all of this experts are doing to help others.

## What it is **not**

We just want to clarify what this is not, it is **NOT**:

* A list of people working on the support team
* A list of people publicly committed to answer any request/question they receive on any channel

## Tips and tricks

## Solving your questions on GeoNet

[GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/) is the Official Esri Community, there you will find "[Places](https://community.esri.com/places)" (*[learn more about Places](https://community.esri.com/docs/DOC-1081)*) for almost each topic you will find experts on this project.

If case you have any doubt **do not contact this experts directly**, instead use GeoNet to ask your question so anyone else in the community can benefit from the answer.

> **Recomendation**: mention specific experts using the character `@`.

You can learn more how GeoNet works in the [GeoNet Manual](https://community.esri.com/docs/DOC-11240-geonet-manual).
